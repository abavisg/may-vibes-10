# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files for the extension:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons are referenced in the manifest.json file and are used in various Chrome UI locations:
- 16x16: Favicon
- 48x48: Chrome Web Store and extension management page
- 128x128: Chrome Web Store and installation dialog

For the final extension, replace these placeholder files with actual icons representing the "Gmail Newsletter Unsubscriber" extension.

Icon design suggestions:
- Include visual elements related to email/newsletters
- Use an unsubscribe or removal symbol
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Follow Material Design guidelines for a modern look
